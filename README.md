## Bandit Algorithms in Python

This project implements bandit algorithms from _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_.
Currently, it only uses the Numpy package for the algorithms, but it requires matplotlib and pandas for relevant visualizations.

### Bandit Algorithms

The repository currently implements the following algorithms:
- Epsilon-Greedy
- Epsilon-Greedy (with optimistic initialization)
- Upper Confidence Bound Selection
